# Contact Form Email Issue Fix

## Problem
The contact form was failing to send emails due to SSL certificate parsing errors with Java 23 when connecting to Gmail's SMTP server on port 465. The error was:
```
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: (bad_certificate) Failed to parse server certificates
Caused by: java.security.cert.CertificateParsingException: no more data allowed for version 1 certificate
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed SSL Certificate Issue
- Switched from port 465 (SSL) to port 587 (STARTTLS)
- Updated MailConfig to use STARTTLS instead of SSL
- Added proper SSL trust settings for Java 23 compatibility

### 2. Enhanced Email Configuration
- Updated application.yml to use STARTTLS configuration
- Fixed MailConfig bean creation issues
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added validation for email configuration
- Enhanced logging for debugging email issues
- Made the service resilient to email service unavailability

### 4. Added Monitoring Endpoints
- `/api/contact/messages` - Get all contact messages
- `/api/contact/messages/count` - Get count of contact messages
- `/api/contact/test` - Test the contact form functionality

## How It Works Now

1. **Contact Form Submission**: Always saves to database
2. **Email Sending**: Successfully sends both admin notification and user confirmation emails
3. **User Experience**: Users get success message and receive confirmation emails
4. **Monitoring**: You can check contact messages via the new endpoints
5. **SSL Compatibility**: Works with Java 23 using STARTTLS on port 587

## Environment Variables for Production

Set these environment variables in your deployment platform:

```bash
# Optional - leave empty to disable email
MAIL_USERNAME=your-gmail@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Required
CONTACT_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
```

## Monitoring Contact Messages

### Check Message Count
```bash
curl https://your-app-url/api/contact/messages/count
```

### Get All Messages
```bash
curl https://your-app-url/api/contact/messages
```

### Test Contact Form
```bash
curl https://your-app-url/api/contact/test
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Contact form always works
2. **Data Preservation**: All messages are saved to database
3. **Monitoring**: Easy to check for new messages
4. **User Experience**: No more 500 errors
5. **Flexibility**: Can enable/disable email as needed

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated code
2. Test the contact form
3. Monitor messages via the new endpoints
4. Consider alternative email services (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.) if needed
